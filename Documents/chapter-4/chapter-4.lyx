Steller Sea Lion Dataset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of Steller Sea Lion Count competition is to estimate the number
 of each type of sea lions in a given image.
 The different types of sea lions are: adult males, subadult males, adult
 females, juveniles and pups.
 There are totally 947 training images and 18639 testing images.
 For each training image, we have two versions: the original image and the
 one with colored dots in the center of each sea lion.
 Different images may have different sizes but all the sizes are around
 4500 x 3000 x 3, thus the image is quite large occupying around 5MB.
 The large amount of high resolution images introduce two major problems.
 First, during training we need to deal with memory consumption and we may
 need to split the image into patches or resize the image in order to fit
 them into GPU's memory.
 Second, in the testing phase, we need to have short inference time due
 to the huge amount testing images.

, a sampled training image pair is provided.
 Different dot color indicates different sea lion types:

, there are some black regions in the labeled images.
 The black regions are added by the data provider in order to filter out
 controversial sea lions (even the experts find it difficult to distinguish
 the sea lion type).
 Another thing to notice is that the number of sea lions per image varies
 a lot.
 We can have an image containing more than 900 sea lions or an image containing
 only 3.
 Also it is not a uniform distribution for different sea lion types.

\begin_layout Standard
In our experiments, we construct our own testing set from the 947 training
 images.
 More specifically, all the images with id 750 â€“ 947 are used as test set
 which are never been seen in the training phase.
 These testing images are used as the indicator of algorithm performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data Preprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to construct the training dataset, some data preprocessing is needed.
 First of all, we use blob detection to get the color of each centered dot
 and its coordinates.
 Then we can use these coordinates to construct dot labeled inputs which
 are required in Count-ception architecture.
 In order to deal with GPU memory consumption, we exploit two methods: image
 scaling and separation.
 Data augmentation is used to balance sea lion types and improve classification
 performance.

\begin_layout Subsection
Blob Detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In computer vision, blob detection methods aim at detecting regions in a
 digital image that differ in properties, such as brightness or color, compared
 to surrounding regions.
 Roughly speaking, a blob is a region of an image in which some properties
 are constant or approximately constant; all the points in a blob can be
 considered in some sense to be similar to each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dot in labeled images is a blob which contains the similar pixel values
 within a small region, thus we can use blob detection to find the center
 coordinates of the dot.
 After we get the center coordinates, we can use RGB values to classify
 its color and get the corresponding sea lion type.
 Luckily we don't need to implement blob detection algorithm from scratch,
 there are many open source implementations for this algorithm and in this
 thesis we use the version provided by OpenCV.
 Here are the decision rules we used as a look up table in order to classify
 dot color using its RGB values:

Target Map Construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to calculate the loss for Count-ception architecture, we need to
 construct the target map manually.
 After we get the coordinates for each sea lion, we can construct a dot
 label image indicating positions of each sea lion.
 This dot image has the same dimension as the original image and has 255
 pixel value at each sea lion position while all the other pixel values
 are zero.
 Padding is used to deal with sea lions near the image boarder.

\begin_layout Subsection
Image resizing and separation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original sea lion image has quite high resolution and it can consume
 too much memory.
 When we train our neural network with GPU, we not only need to load the
 image, but also need to store the parameters and all the intermediate values
 which are used to calculate gradients in back propagation.
 In order to deal with this memory issue, we mainly exploit image scaling
 and separation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In computer graphics and digital imaging, image scaling refers to the resizing
 of a digital image.
 When scaling a vector graphic image, the graphic primitives that make up
 the image can be scaled using geometric transformations, without loss of
 image quality.
 When scaling a raster graphics image, a new image with a higher or lower
 number of pixels must be generated.
 In case of decreasing the pixel number this usually results in a quality
 loss.
 There are quite some image rescaling algorithms, like Nearest-neighbor
 interpolation, bilinear and bicubic algorithm, and etc.
 The details of these algorithms are not our concern, and we are more interested
 in the downsampling effect.
 The sea lion images are raster graphics and we half its size to reduce
 memory consumption.
 As a result we lose some pixel information and everything becomes smaller.
 There are mainly two effects:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By losing some pixel values, the information left may not be sufficient
 to distinguish each sea lion type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When we downsample the image, everything becomes smaller and thus we need
 re-design the receptive field size in order to better fit each sea lion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another method to deal with memory consumption is to separate each image
 into tiles and then process each tile to sum up the counts as the final
 result.
 By using this method, we do not lose pixel values and each object does
 not shrink.
 However, when we generate tiles using a non-overlapping sliding window,
 we may cut off some objects and this can hurt performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a word, both image scaling and separation have disadvantages and in fact
 using these two methods is just a compromise due to the limited memory
 of GPU.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Augmentation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data augmentation is a common technique used to improve the performance
 of neural networks.
 It is a common knowledge that the more data an ML algorithm has access
 to, the more effective it can be

\end_inset

.
 Overfitting is a challenge for deep learning models due to insufficient
 amount of data and complex network structures.
 We can not simplify the deep learning architecture when we have a non trivial
 problem but we can increase the training data by data augmentation.
 Given an input image, we can rotate, flip and zoom it to enrich our dataset.
 Data augmentation is working because we manually create more learnable
 samples to provide for our network.
 It is known that CNN has translation invariance due to the calculating
 mechanism of convolution, but when the object has different scales or is
 rotated in the testing images, it is not an easy task for the network to
 still recognize it.
 Thus by manually creating more possible poses of the objects, CNN can perform
 better.

\begin_layout Standard
In Steller sea lion dataset, we use image rotation and flipping to create
 more training samples and improve classification performance.
 We did not use zooming operation because the images are taken by a drone,
 which flied in the same height, thus all the sea lions have the same scale.
