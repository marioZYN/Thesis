These are very personal suggestions, no offense will be taken if you completely
 ignore this chapter.

\begin_layout Section
Inception Network
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Inception network is an important milestone of CNN classifiers.
 Before Inception network, most popular CNN networks just stack convolution
 layers deeper and deeper, hoping to get better performance.
 However, deeper network has more parameters which make gradient descent
 less effective and lead to overfitting.
 The Inception network is carefully designed in terms of speed and accuracy
 while keeping the computational budget constant.
 The network is organized in the form of 
\begin_inset Quotes cld
\end_inset

Inception module
\begin_inset Quotes crd
\end_inset

 which makes it possible for the network to grow both in width and depth.
 The performance is verified by GoogleLeNet, a 22 layers deep network which
 won ILSVRC14 competition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main difference between Inception module and normal CNN convolution
 layer is that Inception uses various sizes of filters in each layer while
 CNN uses only one.
 The idea of Inception architecture is based on finding out how an optimal
 local sparse structure in a convolutional vision network can be approximated.
 One straight forward way is to use more than one filter size and let the
 training phase to decide the best approximation area.
 The outputs of each filter are stacked together to form the input of the
 next stage.
 As we can see in the figure, there are three shapes of filter: 1x1, 3x3
 and 5x5.
 The 1x1 filter is also used for dimension reduction.
 In the left figure, we can see the naive implementation of this idea.
 This implementation, however, has one big issue, even a modest number of
 5x5 convolutions can be prohibitively expensive on top of a convolutional
 layer with a large number of filters.
 This problem becomes even more pronounced when we stack all the outputs
 together.
 This leads to the second implementation structure, as we can see in the
 right figure.
 Whenever the computational requirements increase too much, we can simply
 apply a 1x1 convolution to reduce the dimension.
 Another thing to mention is the max pooling layer, it exists for no particular
 reason.
 Historically, good performance networks have pooling layers.

\begin_layout Standard
Inception module is the fundamental element in inception architectures.
 By concatenating various sizes of filters in each layer and using 1x1 filters
 to reduce dimensions, the network can grow wider and deeper.
 Since Inception module is invented, several improvements are made over
 the years.
 However in this thesis, we only use the idea of stacking various sizes
 of filters and ignore other tricks.
 So the details of the improvements are not discussed here, only a summary
 is provided.

\begin_layout Itemize
Inception v1 concatenates Inception modules to make the network wider and
 deeper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inception v2 uses two 3x3 filters to replace 5x5 filters, decomposes nxn
 filers into 1xn and nx1 filters in order to increase computation speed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inception v3 introduces rmsprop, factorized 7x7 filters and batch normalization

\begin_layout Section
Reviews
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your advisor will review what are you writing and he will, most likely,
 add annotations on a 
\family sans
pdf
\family default
.
 However, correction contained inside annotations are difficult to integrate,
 manly because you will spend a lot of time in finding where to modify your
 document.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 supports a very powerful method to review a document, just look the examples
 below.
\end_layout

\change_deleted -898145728 1390600833
In my opinion
\change_inserted -898145728 1390660018
After having considered all the other solutions we proved that
\change_unchanged
 this is the most efficient way to determine the medium length of horse's
 mane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These result shows that the first method is way better than the second.

The integration of these reviews is much easier than reviews inside annotation
 of a 
\family sans
pdf
\family default
.
 Unfortunately you have to convince your advisor to use this system, I think
 it is worth a try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature is called 
\family sans
Change Tracking
\family default
, there is a dedicated toolbar that you can show by activating the 
\family sans
Change Track
\family default
 option (
\family sans
Document \SpecialChar menuseparator
 Change Tracking \SpecialChar menuseparator
 Track Changes
\family default
 or simply 
\family sans
CTRL + SHIFT + E
\family default
).
 This document has the 
\family sans
Change Tracking
\family default
 option already enabled.

\begin_layout Section
Final presentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have written your thesis you will have to present it.
 Timing is critical.
 You will have from 
\begin_inset Formula $15$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $20$
\end_inset

 minutes to present the work of months.
 A very useful tool that you may use during your presentation is 
\family typewriter
pdfpc
\family default
 (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://davvil.github.io/pdfpc/
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 By using this program, on the screen of your laptop you will have some
 additional information that are not showed on the external monitor.
 These extra information are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Time
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

left you can set the duration of the presentation and see how many minutes
 and seconds you have left
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Next
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

slide you will see both the current and the next slide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Annotations you can add some annotation to remember you some key points
 that you may forget
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool is very very useful, but do not forget that there is always the
 demo effect.
 You MUST try it before even thinking to use for your final presentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To install the program on a Linux system there should be a package named
 
\family sans
pdf-presenter-console
\family default
, for other OS on the websites of the program there are the instruction
 how to install it.
