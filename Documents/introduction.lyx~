Steller sea lions in the western Aleutian Islands have declined 94 percent
 in the last 30 years.
 The endangered western population, found in the North Pacific, are focus
 of conservation efforts which require annual population counts.
 Specifically trained scientists at NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science
 Center conduct these surveys using airplanes and unoccupied aircraft systems
 to collect aerial images.
 Having accurate population estimates enables scientists to better understand
 factors that may be contributing to lack of recovery of Stellers in this
 area.
 Currently, it takes biologists up to four months to count sea lions from
 the thousand of images NOAA Fisheries collects each year.
 Once individual counts are conducted, the tallies must be reconciled to
 confirm their reliability.
 The results of these counts are time-sensitive.
 Automating the annual population count will free up critical resources,
 and allow experts to focus on core research.
 Plus, advancements in computer vision applied to aerial population counts
 may also greatly benefit other endangered species.

Since Alex re-introduced CNN architecture into computer vision field, deep
 learning methods become the state-of-art for image classification, localization
, segmentation, as well as many other vision recognization tasks.
 Image classification is the task of giving an input image, outputting a
 corresponding label.
 The algorithm is usually trained with very large labeled dataset and the
 outputs are constrained to the labels we have in the training samples.
 Image localization and segmentation are more difficult than classification.
 Localization algorithm outputs a bounding box around each object and a
 corresponding label.
 In order to do this, the training data needs to have both the labels and
 the bounding boxes indicating the object location.
 This kind of dataset occupies large amount of time from human labelers
 and thus it is more difficult to construct.
 Segmentation algorithm requires pixel-leveled prediction for each object
 and this kind of training is even more time consuming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose for this thesis is to develop an algorithm for simultaneous
 classification and counting.
 Given an input image, we output the label and the corresponding count for
 each object.
 There are various kinds of situations where we could apply this algorithm
 to, for example, the counting problem for endangered animals like the sea
 lions described above.
 By using our algorithm, generating sea lion counting numbers in each image
 can be fully automated.
 Also in biological imaging, we could use this algorithm to produce precise
 counts for cells and tissues, helping doctors to analyze the disease.
 Moreover, the training dataset is a lot easier to construct: we only need
 to have a labeled dot for each object, no bounding boxes are required.
 This kind of dataset is more common than bounding box labeled or pixel-level
 labeled dataset.

The main challenge for this thesis is the inherent difficulty of our sea
 lion images which have small and similar objects but complex background
 environment.
 Moreover, each image has quite high resolution which makes it difficult
 for managing algorithm speed and memory consumption.
 As we can see in Figure

, dense sea lion distribution on the rocks makes it difficult to classify
 sea lion type and generate precise counts.

In this thesis, we developed two major solutions for multi-object counting
 problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reformulate the problem of object counting as object classification and
 use CNN to solve it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Build a regression network optimized for object counting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our algorithm focuses on the second solution which uses Count-ception architectu
re

 and fully convolutional mechanism

 to generate counting numbers directly.
 The first solution is used as a baseline.
 We show that our algorithm which is optimized for object counting achieves
 superior performance than using classification to generate object counts.
 We use the sea lions dataset provided by NOAA Kaggle Competition to run
 our experiments.

The thesis is structured as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Chapter 1, we review deep learning algorithms in computer vision field,
 including image classification, object detection and localization algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Chapter 2, we introduce Count-ception architecture and explain why this
 can solve object counting problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Chapter 3, we present our major contribution which is a modified version
 of Count-ception architecture, able to perform object classification and
 counting at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Chapter 4, we deal with dataset construction and preprocessing techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Chapter 5, algorithm performance is analyzed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, conclusions and further improvements are provided.
