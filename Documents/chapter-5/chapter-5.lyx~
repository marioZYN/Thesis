\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we talk about the performance of our algorithm.
 First of all, a baseline approach is provided, using sliding window and
 CNN.
 Then we will use Count-ception architecture to do binary counting which
 does not require any classification.
 Finally we discuss our modified version of Count-ception network, able
 to do classification and counting at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Baseline Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use sliding window patch extraction and CNN patch classification as a
 baseline approach to our sea lion counting problem.
 The whole pipeline for this approach is provided here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extract 96 x 96 patches from original images to construct training dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Train our CNN network which is able to do 6 class classification (5 sea
 lion types + background).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In testing phase, we manually divide the image into patches and gather the
 classification results as the counting prediction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Patch extraction and training set construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We already have each sea lion coordinates by using blob detection introduced
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:fourth-chapter"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and we use these coordinates as patch centers.
 Each patch is of size 96 x 96 and we discard the illegal patches which
 are not big enough due to its location near the image boarder.
 Including background patch, we have totally 6 types of patches, and a sample
 of them is shown in figure

\begin_layout Standard
From all the training images, we extract 1000 patches for each sea lion
 type, and among them 85% are used as training, 15% are used as validation.
 We train our network in a mini-batch manner and each mini-batch contains
 30 patches under uniform sea lion distribution.

CNN overview

\begin_layout Standard
Our CNN architecture takes a 96 x 96 x 3 patch as input and classifies it
 among six possible labels\SpecialChar endofsentence

\begin_layout Standard
The last layer in this CNN is a fully connected layer and we append a softmax
 layer after it to convert the outputs into classification scores.

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This network is trained for 100 epochs under 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 learning rate.
 Since it is a classification network, we use cross entropy loss with Adam
 optimization and in order to have a better sense of the network performance,
 we add accuracy as an evaluation metric.
 The training and validation performance is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Baseline-training-performance"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As we can see, overfitting happens after around 35 epochs.
 We use the model with the best validation score to conduct testing.

\begin_layout Standard
We have a six-class classification problem with uniform data distribution
 and the accuracy we achieved after training is around 50%.
 So it is actually not bad for our CNN to classify patches.
 As mentioned before, we can get sea lion count prediction by first separating
 the whole image into patches and then sum up classification results.
 The test dataset we construct has totally 184 images and the testing performanc
e is summarized in the following table:

\begin_layout Standard
We have very high counting error for juveniles and pups and there are mainly
 two reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Juveniles and pups are inherently difficult to detect because they have
 smaller sizes compared to other sea lion types.
 Also pups look like rocks a lot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
By using non-overlapping patches with classification, we assume that the
 sea lions lie at the center of each patch, and there are maximumly one
 sea lion in each patch.
 However in the images, sea lions not always lie in the patch centers and
 pups, for most of the time, lie very near to other sea lions (possibly
 their mothers).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baseline approach treats counting problem as classification problem.
 Although we could achieve quite good results on classification, the counting
 performance is not so good due to the limitation of the algorithm itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Binary Counting with Count-ception
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We create a modified version of Count-ception architecture to generate binary
 counts for our sea lion images.
 This network has receptive filed size 48 x 48 and it generates a single
 prediction map indicating the number of all sea lion types.
 We design this architecture as a startup for our final algorithm and use
 it to verify that our Count-ception network works for sea lion dataset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With learning rate equals to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

, the network is trained for 60 epochs under Adam optimization.
 We use 50 training images and each of them are divided into 25 non-overlapping
 patches in order to deal with GPU's memory issue.
 Thus there are totally 1250 patches, among them 85% of them are used in
 training and the rest are used as validation dataset.
 In the testing phase, each image is first separated into 25 patches and
 then sea lion count predictions of each patch are summed up to generate
 the final result.
