This thesis concerns automated object classification and counting in high
 resolution images.
 The approach we take is to use a fully convolutional network based Count-ceptio
n architecture to regress a spatial density map across the image.
 Training our model end-to-end in a fully convolutional manner is beneficial
 to the images which have objects overlapping or very close to each other.
 High resolution images make GPU training difficult because it will occupy
 a lot of memory, and we tackle this problem by dividing the whole image
 into several patches.
 The original Count-ception architecture only deals with single object counting,
 and we append more filters in the final convolution layer in order to integrate
 classification functionality.
 During our experiments we find that unbalanced object distribution harms
 the performance and moreover low density target maps will force our algorithm
 to output zero.
 We solve this problem by inserting a weight balance layer which assigns
 weight coefficients in the loss function.
 Positive pixel values will be assigned a weight factor larger than zero
 pixels.

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-objects counting in crowded images is an extremely time consuming
 task encountered in many real-world applications.
 In a lot of situations we do not need to predict exact locations for each
 object, thus we would like to avoid using complex models for object detection
 like faster R-CNN.
 We proposed this modified version of Count-ception architecture for simultaneou
sly object classification and counting, and testify it on the sea lion dataset
 provided by NOAA.
 Since the sea lion dataset is inherently difficult with complex backgrounds
 and very similar objects, we can foresee that our algorithm can be applied
 for many other problems as well, including biology, remote sensing, surveillanc
e, and etc.

Further improvements

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, there are some challenges we could not fully solve.
 Also there are some ideas we do not have time to test and we leave them
 as possible further improvements.

, in order to deal with GPU's memory consumption we can resort to image
 separation or image scaling.
 However both methods have disadvantages and can harm performance.
 We process the whole image in a fully convolutional way in order to deal
 with images having object clumping and overlapping, but by doing image
 separation we may cutoff object clusters or object itself at the very beginning.
 For achieving better object counting performance, it's better to use GPU
 with high memory.

\begin_layout Subsection*
More complex Count-ception architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the thesis, we basically keep the stucture of the original Count-ception
 architecture.
 Instead of making it deeper, we keep the depth and only change the receptive
 filed size.
 The reason to do it is to make the number of parameters as small as possible
 in the concern of both convergence speed and memory usage.
 Actually it is natural to design a more complex network structure when
 we are facing a difficult dataset, so it is worth a try in the future.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Spatial correlation in heat maps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We generate object counts by doing redundant counting and summing up all
 the pixel values in the predicted map.
 We would say this is a very preliminary usage of heat maps.
 Fully convolutional networks generate heat maps which contain spatial informati
on and we could exploit this for better performance.
 For example, after getting the predicted sea lion heat maps, we could combine
 some primer knowledge (pups appear near their mums, etc...) to do further
 processing, like constructing a CRF (Conditional Random Field) to do spatial
 correlation.
